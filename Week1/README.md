# Week 1 Challenge: Static website hosting on AWS, Azure or GCP and implement CICD 🚀

This week's challenge will explore critical concepts and services related to cloud storage, content delivery, and DNS management 🔍 We will also implement CICD for automated changes to your website.

## Technologies Covered 📚 ( Use either of the below options)
- **AWS**: Amazon S3, CloudFront, and Route 53
- **Azure**: Azure Storage, Azure CDN, and DNS Management
- **Google Cloud**: Cloud Storage, Load Balancing, and Content Delivery Networks (CDN)

## Get Started 🚀
- Review the challenge requirements. ✔️
- Dive into AWS, Azure, or GCP documentation to get familiar with the services mentioned. 📖
- Start building your architecture diagram. 🏗️
- Document your progress in a blog or GitHub Readme. 📝

## Deliverables 📦

In this challenge, you are expected to produce the following deliverables:

### 1. Architecture Diagram 🏗️
A comprehensive architecture diagram illustrates how the various cloud services and components fit together. You can use tools like draw.io, Lucidchart, or any other diagramming tool of your choice to create the diagram. 📊

### 2. Blog or GitHub Readme 📄
You should document your progress and steps taken during the challenge. This documentation could be in the form of a blog post or a GitHub Readme file. Include code snippets, configuration files, and explanations for each step. Share your insights and learning experiences. 📝

Here's a suggested outline for your documentation:
